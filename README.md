## How to run (assuming you have python):
1.) Make sure Django is installed. Best way to check is to run `$ python -m django --version`. If it gives you an error, you do not have django installed. Run `$ python -m pip install django` to install django
2.) Change your directory to the location of the project. Make sure you are in the same folder as manage.py. Example: `$ cd .../FinalProject/FinalProject/`
3.) Migrate the project by running `$ python manage.py migrate`
4.) Run the server locally by running `$ python manage.py runserver`
5.) The output will give you an address to go to, open any browser and paste that address into the search bar
6.) Tada! It should work!
